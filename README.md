# AVR Remotely Controlled Station
This project is a Remotly Controlled Station where the user can control the AVR station from a PC using command over the UART communication protocol, The user can exchange data between the PC and the station such as current temperature or control several peripherals such as a buzzer, or servo motor.





## ⚡Components
 The following components have been used:
 * ATMEGA32 MCU
 * Buzzer
 * LCD
 * Keypad
 * Servo motor
 * Push buttons
 * capacitor and resistor
 * LM35 temperature sensor

## 🛠️Drivers
In order to achive the project funtionality I wrote the following drivers:
* DIO
* Buzzer
* LCD
* Keypad
* Servo
* USART
* ADC
these drivers can be found in /src forlder

## 👨‍💻Simulation
The proteus simulation design can be found in (Design.DSN) file, here is the simulation in action:
